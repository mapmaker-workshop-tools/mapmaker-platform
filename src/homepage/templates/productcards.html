                One of the key features of Mapmaker's hexagon-shaped cards is their unique design. Unlike traditional rectangular-shaped cards, these cards have six sides, allowing participants to organize their ideas in a more flexible and dynamic way. This design encourages participants to think outside the box and explore new connections and possibilities that may not be immediately apparent with traditional cards.

The cards are color-coded to match the different categories and sections of the platform, allowing participants to easily organize and transfer their ideas from the physical cards to the online platform and vice versa. This integration creates a seamless and cohesive learning experience that allows participants to fully engage with the content and achieve their learning objectives.
