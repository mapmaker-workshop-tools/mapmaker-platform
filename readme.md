# Mapmaker -- Platform
Mapmaker is the online platform for the Mapmaker methodology. We open sourced the project so we can be transparant on what we do. It also allows you to run the platform on your own hardware if you choose to do so. 

## TL:DR:
- Our [platform](https://mapmaker.nl) -- and our homepage 
- Our development [platform](https://triage.mapmaker.nl) -- for testing new versions
- Upptime status [platform](https://status.mapmaker.nl) -- Is our server up or down

## Help I can't code: is there a way to use the platform without knowing how to code?
Yes definetly drop us a [message](https://mapmaker.nl/contact) and we'll work something out. We use our version of the platform for all our workshops and it runs very smooth.  

## I'm a developer - How do I run the code? 
Great to hear! Easy: the project is a fairly typical Django project. This means that all you need to do is:
1. clone the repository
2. Create a .env file in src/core with parameters for your Django server to run: here is an example:

```
#Email settings
EMAIL_HOST_USER=
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
#Django settings
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=
DEBUG=False
# S3 storage keys
S3_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
S3_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_SECRET_KEY=
# For creating images -- These help you generate a image of the workshop
HCTI_API_KEY=
HCTI_API_USER_ID=

#Analytics
MIXPANEL_TOKEN=
ENVIRONMENT=

# DEV DATABASE
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_HOST=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=3306
```

3. From here it should be smooth sailing and you should be able to run all the typical Django commands such as: 
`python src/manage.py runserver`
or
`python src/manage.py makemigrations` or `python src/manage.py migrate` for migrations
4. The repository also includes workflows to deploy to production. This requires you also have a Lightsail account with the correct names.
