### Learn more
#### About our offering
This page on Github is meant to share our workshop materials and document issues. If you want to learn more about our offering check out our  [Website](https://mapmaker.nl).


#### About the code
We documented the code of the platform in this repository under 'src'. For more information check out this  [README](https://github.com/two-trick-pony-NL/mapmaker/tree/master/src)


# Open Source and Creative Commons
The collection of works are published on Github and under the BY-NC-ND creative commons license.  This is because we value transparency, as well as want others to benefit from our work. This means you'll be able to host your own sessions using the materials, code and methodology we developed. Restrictions do apply: we do not permit: using the works for commercial purposes, redistribution and modification. If you do want to use these materials send us a message at mapmaker.nl/contact to work out a license agreement.

#### How does Creative commons work?
It's very simple, it is like when you tell someone the magic ingredient of a recipe. Some people choose not to tell what is in the recipe (like coca-cola) others tell what's in it but ask you not to make the same product and there may even be people that will not put any restrictions on how you use the recipe.

For Mapmaker: we chose to tell everyone how our product works under the following conditions:
- You mention that it is our work, and not yours
- You cannot use our work for commercial purposes - Do send us a message if you want to though, as we can work out a license agreement
- If you use our work as a basis and make changes then we do not allow you to distribute that work - So you can make any change for your own use. If you think you can improve the code, then open a pull request.
For the exact stipulations check our Creative Commons license.


#### How do I obtain the workshop Material?
We're still developing the workshop material, but we'll provide a link for you to download our cards in PDF Format HERE once we have them.

#### Where can I read more about your methodology?
We're still writing the material but once we finish we'll post a link HERE.

#### If I want to use the online tool, what should I do?
Either buy a workshop through mapmaker.nl and we'll grant you access, or host your own version. I must say: this is not for the faint of heart and you probably need a software developer to do so.


# The cardset and methodology
Under noncode in this repository you will find the latest iteration of our custom cardset and workshop manuals. You can print these for your own sessions.

# The platform
Under the src folder you'll find all source code for web platform. It's ran off of Django and you'll need to provide your own database to run it.
