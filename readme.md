# Mapmaker -- Platform
Mapmaker is the online platform for the Mapmaker methodology. We open sourced the project so we can be transparant on what we do. It also allows you to run the platform on your own hardware if you choose to do so. 

## TL:DR:
- Our [platform](https://mapmaker.nl) -- and our homepage 
- Our development [platform](https://triage.mapmaker.nl) -- for testing new versions
- Upptime status [platform](https://status.mapmaker.nl) -- Is our server up or down

## Features: 

### A beautiful Hexagon grid for you to lay all out all your workshop cards
#### Create your workshop using the grid
Add, move and update cards as your workshop progresses to end up with the systems map that reflects your situation.

#### Add resources, comments to cards
After the workshop you can add links to important documents, research or other need-to-knows related to a topic. You can also discuss topics with comments and follow cards so you get a notification if anything is updated.

## Help I can't code: is there a way to use the platform without knowing how to code?
Yes definetly drop us a [message](https://mapmaker.nl/contact) and we'll work something out. We use our version of the platform for all our workshops and it runs very smooth.  

## I'm a developer - How do I run the code? 
Great to hear! Easy: the project is a fairly typical Django project. This means that all you need to do is:
1. clone the repository
2. Create a .env file in src/core with parameters for your Django server to run: here is an example:

```
#Email settings
EMAIL_HOST_USER=
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
#Django settings
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=
MAINTENANCEMODE=False
MAINTENANCETEXT="Mapmaker might be unresponsive. Try again in a few minutes."
DEBUG=False
# S3 storage keys
S3_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
S3_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_SECRET_KEY=
# For creating images -- These help you generate a image of the workshop
HCTI_API_KEY=
HCTI_API_USER_ID=

#Analytics
MIXPANEL_TOKEN=
ENVIRONMENT=

# DEV DATABASE
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_HOST=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=3306
```

3. From here it should be smooth sailing and you should be able to run all the typical Django commands such as: 
`python src/manage.py runserver`
or
`python src/manage.py makemigrations` or `python src/manage.py migrate` for migrations
4. The repository also includes workflows to deploy to production. This requires you also have a Lightsail account with the correct names. 

## If you want to use Docker
Then you can use the dockerfiles to build your container. Make sure to run this from the root folder and not src as the command has the path to the dockerfile already. The command also presumes you have the .env file already in the `core` folder. 

`docker build -t mapmaker:latest -f ./Infrastructure/Docker/DockerfilePROD .`

## Use of NGINX is recommended: 
It is recommended that you use nginx as a webserver in front of Django. We offer a container that also copies in the staticfiles into the nginx. For this we offer both a dockerfile as a default.conf file to set up nginx correctly. Both can be found in the `infrastructure/nginx` folder. Or to build a dockerfile

`docker build -t nginx:latest -f ./Infrastructure/nginx/Dockerfile .`

# How to contribute:
If you want to add features or fix bugs then by all means open a pullrequest for us to review your code. 


# License, Open Source and Creative Commons
The collection of works are published on Github and under the BY-NC-ND creative commons license.  This is because we value transparency, as well as want others to benefit from our work. This means you'll be able to host your own sessions using the materials, code and methodology we developed. Restrictions do apply: we do not permit: using the works for commercial purposes, redistribution and modification. If you do want to use these materials send us a [message](https://mapmaker.nl/contact) to work out a license agreement.



### How does Creative commons work?
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71013416/230730932-b32e5048-5d7f-4f81-9df1-bfc658f6f5e4.png" width="100">

It's very simple, it is like when you tell someone the magic ingredient of a recipe. Some people choose not to tell what is in the recipe (like coca-cola) others tell what's in it but ask you not to make the same product and there may even be people that will not put any restrictions on how you use the recipe.

For Mapmaker: we chose to tell everyone how our product works under the following conditions:
- You mention that it is our work, and not yours
- You cannot use our work for commercial purposes - Do send us a [message](https://mapmaker.nl/contact)  if you want to though, as we can work out a license agreement
- If you use our work as a basis and make changes then we do not allow you to distribute that work - So you can make any change for your own use. If you think you can improve the code, then open a pull request.
For the exact stipulations check our Creative Commons license.
